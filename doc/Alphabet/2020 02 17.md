## Day Plan:
- Will develop 2d plotter as well as fixing integration techniques from last session
    - This will be useful for final presentations as well as keeping track of progress
    with pictures and graphs, etc.
## Updates:
- Created AlphabetPlotter.py (in src)
    - Locates acceleration file and converts the acceleration data into position.
    - Plots acceleration in x vs t, acceleration in y vs t, 
    as well as path traced by the accelerometer on the same window.
