## Day Plan:
- Will develop 2d plotter as well as fixing integration techniques from last session
    - This will be useful for final presentations as well as keeping track of progress
    with pictures and graphs, etc.
## Updates:
- Created AlphabetPlotter.py (in src)
    - Locates acceleration file and converts the acceleration data into position.
    - Plots acceleration in x vs t, acceleration in y vs t, 
    as well as path traced by the accelerometer on the same window.
### Alphabet data
All letters were drawn so that they can fit into a 30cmx30cm square. 

Recorded and plotted following letters:

a, B, b, C, c, D, e, G, g, h, J, L, l, M, m, N, n, O, o, P, p, q, R, r, 
S, s, T, U, u, V, v, W, w, Z, z

We are just missing A, F, f, H, I, i, j, K, k, Q, t, X, x, Y, y.

.csv files saved in data/Alphabet

On every corner of each letter, make a hard stop to ensure that the
data gives a corner when converted to position.

Adamo's phone (Huawei P20) drifts to the left, made up for this by 
adding extra acceleration to the right where needed (eg. tail of a u or q)
