# Handwriting Alphabet Lab Information
## Changes
- Developed Grapher.py and ConvertToPosition.py so that 3d values would come out as positions when accel file is selected.
- Took data on Hyphen, Slash, O
## Issues 
- Conversion from acceleration to position not accurate for rotational motion
    - Will work build code from ground up next time
- Use of Plotter.py and Load.py files will be useful.
