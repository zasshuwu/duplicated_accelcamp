Day 1 (Monday):
	Device:
		All X-Models:
			1) The Devices record acceleration in counts (not in g's or m/s2)
			2) For different X-models and settings, the conversion rate between counts and g's is different
	turntable:
	Battery wires found loose could not conduct experiment
Day 2:
	Script stalling
	conversion x6 tbd
	Load_xxx.py is fully functional
	naming format set in stone
		File
			name/id.type.device.csv
			Type: accel or omega
	directory struct
	data-> dataset# -> Run# -> files(files should not be visible)



Day 3:
	user selected time in PlotAcc after time synchronization

TensorFlow first setup with Guillaume from Mila.
todo: install TensorFlow on our machines, validate that we can run src/tf/tfPhysics.py

Day 4:
	Jeff's steps:
	tensorflow error:
	Had to downgrade to python 3.6
	then ran 'pip install tensorflow' 
	attempted to run tfPhysics.py
	ran into these errors when running in PyCharm
	"""
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy.core._multiarray_umath'

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

	Jerome's works with anaconda

	spike tracker algorithm is complete
		alignment
	catch errors that may occur

Day 5:
	FutureWarning: Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated; use `arr[tuple(seq)]` instead of `arr[seq]`. In the future this will be interpreted as an array index, `arr[np.array(seq)]`, which will result either in an error or a different result.
  Y[sl] = X[sl] 


Day 6:
	Fixed a levelling issue using four scissor stands to make small compensations to create a flat and level surface
Day 7:
	Addressed and prioritized all tasks sent by mio.

Day 8:
	TestCurvature line 32 breaks the script
	TestLoadPlot just not working.
	Load.py and LoadRun in that, acceldata Time is larger that omegadata Time
