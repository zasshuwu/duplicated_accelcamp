# Investigation of failed rotation algorithm
2020 02 08

## summary

- Last week we suceeded in making TF optimize over the basic radial variable.
We added a rotation operation as well but it failed to converge.

- In Izk.py I established TF's ability to optimize on simple cosine operations.
The test is interesting, as it demonstrates how we can boil down TF usage to a single data
point, allowing problems to be more easily identified.

- Extending the method to a single-data-point full vec3 rotation failed.
Various tests reveal the problem to be in the type returned by rot_xy.
I applied a reshaping operation to the output and now it seems to behave
reasonably.

## TODO: 
- Fix the graphing code that goes with it. 
- Apply the graphing code to the cosine test as well.
- try different loss functions that operate on a vector value
    - eg norm, square, etc..
- try different optimizers
    - to obtain more stable convergence
- Visualize the loss field
    - in 1D: as a function of phi; function of radius
    - in 2D: both variables
        - in both rectangular and circular coordinates
