Notes for 2020 02 18 ( a Tuesday )

Plots of cost function. This first one is in the "quasi-uniform" regime. It uses a positive a_t value. ( The "ratio" is delta_v/v  )

TODO: Fix title so that we can write out "delta_v/v" using the correct symbols

TODO: how to dump a list of keyword/value pairs into a graph caption.

This next one is in the "kickstart" regime. Also positive at value. Note the scale on the y-axis: it is a much tighter minimum. But, both graphs are exhibiting the same 1/r behaviour in both "regimes".

Here is same as previous, only using a negative at value. Note the ratio is now a negative value; but everything else behaves the same.
