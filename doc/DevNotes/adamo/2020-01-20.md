#January 20, 2020 Notes
- Read through published documentation, as well as PositionViaRegression.pdf (in progress)
- Ran 10 runs of acceleration data, using Pocket accelerometer.
    - Moved sensor over 1cm after every run to work on Linear Regression that we learned in PositionViaRegression file.
- Started writing out an excel sheet that will calculate the position of the accelerometer. 
    - Justin is writing using a different approach to calculate the position, which will give our answers more reliability.
