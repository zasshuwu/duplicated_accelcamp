# Development Notes - Day 3
Date: 03 Feb, 2020

## Tasks:

- Ventured into graphical user interface
- Discuss with experimental team to design and develop the inertia-related tests
- (For now) settled with tkinter for interface building
- Discuss within the software dev team to implement more functions into the tensorflow group

## Details:
- GUI development:
    - Geting into the tkinter module is quite challenging because of the non-linear nature of the interface and tkinter is a top-down UI packager.
    - Actually considering other alternatives.
- Tensorflow:
    - Jerome has wonderfully implemented new functionalities to recover parametres.
    - tfPhysics, tf...noRot working fine
    - Sending code base to Gyom for further insight and verifications

## Next session:
- (Self) going back to the backend development since I think I've strayed too far from god. Need to get myself up to speed with the data analysis development.
- (Self) talk about the symposium poster and oral presentation with P.I.
- Discuss about the on-site visit time schedules for Prof. Silerova.
