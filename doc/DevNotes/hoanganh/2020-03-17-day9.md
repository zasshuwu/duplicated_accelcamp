# Dev Update
Day 9 - 2020-03-17

## Tasks set out to do and completed
It has been a slow work day so this is the only feature I managed to roll out:
- Dump to CSV file format by utlizing np.asarray and np.savetxt, will add more to format the data to conform with the format that we have been using to import and process our data.
