# Development Notes - Day 5 
Date: Feb 17, 2020

## Journal log:
- Held discussion with experiment team to see how dope they are with their handwriting mapping.
- Talked about my function in the project and possibility of diverging into the web development territory.
- Discussed refactoring the project repository after second dev1 merge request
- Fixed broken PATH method. Detailed below.

**For CLI operations**, when running the scripts from the shell with Python, must specify the PYTHONPATH environment directory to src folder:
```
$ PYTHONPATH_ENV=/path/to/src/folder python script_you_want_to_run.py
```

**For PyCharm IDE operations:** 

*Steps/Name may vary depend on which OS you are using*

- File &rightarrow; Preferences &rightarrow; Project: __name__ &rightarrow; Project Structure &rightarrow; Select and  Mark ```src``` folder as **Source**.

- Open your Run/Debug Configurations window in PyCharm IDE and make sure **Add content roots to PYTHONPATH** & **Add source roots to PYTHONPATH** are checked.

--------------
Now that we have figured out how Python module and package referencing works, we can move forward with refactoring the project structure as more tools and tests are added.
