# 2020 03 09 - Day 8

## Tasks:
- **Merge dev branch to master.** As part of newly proposed weekly merge workflow. This is to update the master branch with (potentially working and perfected) codes developed during the week. I believe this is a good practice (you know, to practice), since the project has the potential to blow up in the future with more contributors and we need to have a certain control over how codes are being reviewed and implemented. Think of it as a production pipeline and a version release cycle if you will.
- **Re-implementation of Captioning function.** The captioning function successfully developed during the 7th dev cycle has been re-implemented to match the new MultiplotterNew function and to be able to call itself with any other plotting methods. Also added user-input captioning functionality for value dictionary, because each graph plotted is case-specific so there would be no way to extract parameter values varying from run to run.
- **COST FUNCTION IS SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED.** Results available to be admired in group log.
- **Unit testing gets further support.** Extend the functionality of unit testings using pycharm argument injection in the unit test configuration.
```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s project_directory -v -k *pattern1* -p *pattern2
