# Development notes
Date: 2020-01-27

## Tasks:
1. Fix modules in the Tensorflow source (Jerome) (completed)
2. Draft a program flow for user interface (HA) (Completed)
3. Start developing the interface (HA) (In progress)

## Details
1. Modules in Tensorflow source code:
    - Refactoring
    - Major bug fixes in ```tfPhysics, tfAccelOptimizer```
    - Implement cost function into the ```tfPhysics``` module
    - Implement synthetic data into ```tf.placeholder```
2. General overview of program flow: TO BE ILLUSTRATED LATER
3. Developing the user interface:
    - Start ```index.py``` script
    - Choose use synthetic data or use experimental data
    - Implement default parameters for synthetic data generated for Curvature analysis
    - GenADot and xy^2 generation successful
    - The skeleton for the analysis was adapted from ```Test_Curvature.py``` module.

## Plan for next session:
- Continue working on the user interface ```index.py```
