### Journal:
- Integration of new Multiplotter wrapper into conslidated Multiplotter. This was done in a new Plotter_Integration.py file. Once everything checks out and works, the current Plotter.py will be deprecated and replaced.
- Integration of the Polyplotter.
- Currently, all legends and caption generators are offline for better debugging of the new Plotter. Will be reactivated.

Example of multiplotter and polyplotter in work
