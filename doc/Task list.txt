
Testing infrastructure:
- get unittest package working
- rework existing tests to automation mode: ie. remove need for user input

PyCharm features:
- how to find source definitions
eg from Load import *  : why cant I click on "Load" and it opens the file?
eg run = LoadRun()  : why cant i click on LoadRun() and it brings me to its source-code definition?

refactoring:
- Test_SPikePlot : make SpikeAdjust() work on single AccelData, then MultiSpikeAdjust()
