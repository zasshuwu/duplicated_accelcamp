When unittest module is installed,
under pycharm can be run via drop-down menu.

When it runs, it automatically picks up the following types of files:
- filename must be of form *Test*.py

- inside such files:
  1. must have something that runs at the global scope, and not ifdef'ed to be main, i.e.
    a file with

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()

will NOT be included, but a file with just
    run()
WILL be included.

2. If the code breaks ( syntax ), then it will be considered a failed test
If it passes, but funciton name is not of the form *test*() , then
ignored, not considered as a test

3. Another mechanism for including a test is to import unittest,
and derive a class from Class UnitTest

4. Tests that derive from unittest will be listed with a green check mark when they pass
Tests that are run only because of filename, will NOT be listed anywhere if they pass.
