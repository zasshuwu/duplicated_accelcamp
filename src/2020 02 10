#Handwriting/Alphabet Lab Development
- Took PocketLab data in named letter forms for use with code.
- Conversion from acceleration to position proved inaccurate when rotational motion analysed.
    - Decided to use Plotter and premade Python file for future use to fix the Grapher and converter.
- Will put ax, ay, vx, vy, and possibly rx and ry on the same sheet for plots.
